Tonight, I noticed something strange in the sky. The moon looked redder than usual, almost as if it were bleeding. I thought it might be a lunar eclipse, but no one else seemed to notice. It was unsettling, to say the least.

The red hue hasn't faded. I checked online, and I can’t find any record of upcoming eclipses or astronomical phenomena that would explain this. I asked a few friends, and they just laughed it off. I can’t shake the feeling that something is wrong.

It’s not just the moon anymore. I saw something… a shadow moving across the moon, something not quite right. I grabbed my camera, but the footage came out corrupted. I swear there was a shape, almost human-like. It sent chills down my spine.

The red moon has started to feel like a constant presence. It’s like it’s watching me. I haven’t slept well in days. Every time I close my eyes, I see it, growing closer, as if it wants something from me. I’m starting to get headaches.

People are beginning to notice. Reports of strange behaviors, erratic mood swings, and insomnia are circulating. I overheard someone on the bus today talking about the "blood moon curse." Are we all feeling it, or is it just a coincidence?

February 2, 2024:

There’s a new theory circulating online: The red moon is a sign of impending doom. The theories range from viral infections to supernatural events. I don’t know what to believe anymore, but I do know that it feels like the air is getting heavier.

Valentine’s Day. But the moon... it's more crimson than ever. I tried to go out tonight, but the streets were empty. It’s like everyone’s hiding, waiting for something to pass. I heard a low humming sound all night, almost like a chant.

Animals are acting strange. Pets are running away, birds are circling the skies at night, and the local wildlife is nowhere to be found. A neighbor said they saw someone standing on their lawn, staring up at the moon, unblinking, for hours.

March 7, 2024:

I’m hearing voices now. They whisper things about the red moon, things I don’t understand. They tell me to wait, to prepare. I can’t make out the language, but the intent feels dark. People are starting to avoid each other, like we’re all infected with something.

March 12, 2024:

It happened. The moon grew so bright last night that it felt like day, but the light was wrong, eerie. I watched as people gathered in the streets, almost in a trance. And then, they started walking toward the horizon, following the red light. I don’t know where they went. I’m the only one left. I don’t know what to do.
